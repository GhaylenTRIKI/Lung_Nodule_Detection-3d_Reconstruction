# Lung_Nodule_Detection_And_3D_Reconstruction
The purpose of this project is to implement a solution of a CAD (Computer-Aided Detection) system that helps medical professionals and radiologists interpret chest scans to look for abnormal masses or nodules of lung cancer. The solution takes as input the slices of a chest CT scan and generates a segmented version with highlighted regions that contain
tumors, a classification of whether the tumor is malignant (cancer) or benign (non-cancer), and an algorithm that can automatically calculate the volume of nodules for all slices in 3D reconstruction <br/>
